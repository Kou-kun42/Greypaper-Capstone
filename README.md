# Video Game Genre Predication ðŸŽ®

In this project, I attempt to create a classification deep learning model to predict the genre of a video game based off its cover artwork.  I've detailed all the steps I worked through to achieve my final results, and I'll provide my insight and thoughts on each point along the process.  The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of neural network development by creating a convolutional neural network that ingests multiclass image data and predicts class properties.

I chose this topic as I just have a general curiousity and interest towards gaming, and I thought it would be fun to bring a light hearted topic and try to apply advanced techniques that could pick up on certain patterns when it comes to marketing and user acquisition.
